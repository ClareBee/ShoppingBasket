# ShoppingBasket
## Code Test in Java - model a shopping basket demonstrating SOLID coding techniques and TDD

**Features: custom exception, interface, method overloading**

The user must be able to:

* add items to the shopping basket,
* remove items from the shopping basket,
* empty the shopping basket.
* be able to calculate the total value of the shopping basket. This should account for:

 - buy-one-get-one-free discounts on items,
 - 10% off on totals greater than Â£20 (after previous discount is applied),
 - 2% off on total for customers with loyalty cards (after all other discounts are applied).

Validate that the code works through passing JUnit tests.
